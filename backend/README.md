secured with a self-signed SSL-certificate, enabling HTTPS for the application. For authentication,
the application uses JSON Web Tokens. The API has been tested through JUnit tests and Postman tests.
The database is running on a MySQL/MariaDB server provided by Loopia, which also provided the email
client used for sending emails. The secret information in application.properties are in a file named
env.properties, which is not included in the GitHub repository.
